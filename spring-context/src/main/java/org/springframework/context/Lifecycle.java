/**
 * A common interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control.
 * The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing.
 * <b>NOTE: This interface does not imply specific(明确的，具体的，特定的) auto-startup semantics.
 * Consider implementing {@link SmartLifecycle} for that purpose.</b>
 * 定义用来启动/停止声明周期控制方法的公共接口。
 * 典型的使用案例就是控制异步处理。
 * 注意：该接口不意味着特定的自动启动语义。
 * 要实现这个目的可以考虑实现{SmartLifecycle}
 *
 * <p>Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in a
 * Spring context) and containers  (typically a Spring {@link ApplicationContext}
 * itself). Containers will propagate start/stop signals to all components that
 * apply within each container, e.g. for a stop/restart scenario at runtime.
 * 可以由组件(通常是Spring上下文中定义的Spring bean)和容器(通常是Spring {@link ApplicationContext}本身)实现。
 * 容器会将启动/停止信号传播到每个容器内应用的所有组件，例如在运行时的停止/重启场景。
 *
 * <p>Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX.
 * In the latter case, the {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter}
 * will typically be defined with an
 * {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler},
 * restricting the visibility of activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle
 * interface.
 * 可用于直接调用或通过JMX进行管理操作。
 * 在后一种情况下，{MBeanExporter}通常用{InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler}，将活动控制组件的可见性限制为生命周期接口。
 *
 * <p>Note that the present {@code Lifecycle} interface is only supported on
 * <b>top-level singleton beans</b>. On any other component, the {@code Lifecycle}
 * interface will remain undetected and hence ignored. Also, note that the extended
 * {@link SmartLifecycle} interface provides sophisticated integration with the
 * application context's startup and shutdown phases.
 * 注意，目前的{Lifecycle}接口只支持顶级单例bean。在任何其他组件上，{Lifecycle}接口将保持未被检测到，因此被忽略。
 * 另外，请注意扩展的{SmartLifecycle}接口提供了与应用程序上下文的启动和关闭阶段的复杂集成。
